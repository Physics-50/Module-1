## Module 1 Overview 

In this module you will measure the speed of sound by exciting a sound wave of a known frequency and measuring its wavelength.  Specifically, you will excite a standing wave of sound in an acoustic levitator, and trap styrofoam beads in the pressure nodes of the standing wave.  Week 1 reading reviews the vocabulary and theory!

One of the main goals of this course is for you to "think like an experimental physicist." Instead of primarily reinforcing specific concepts from other physics courses you've taken, learning objectives for each module focus on the experimental process and analytical skills.  

### Learning Objectives

~~Reinforce concepts you learned in Ph24 and/or Ph51~~ ([why not?](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/PT.3.3816){:target="_blank"})

1. Create and execute a measurement plan for accuracy and precision, based on exploratory observations. 

2. Calculate a physical quantity based on experimental data and its uncertainty.

3. Record and communicate experimental results.


### Optional: DIY Acoustic Levitator!
If after this module you are interested in building your own levitator you can find the AIP publication as well as a link to the materials and instructions below. Happy levitating!
