# Week 2: Final Careful Measurements and Analysis

**The instructions in this week's lab manual do not need to be read in advance. The embedded mini-question should be completed in lab this week rather than in advance; in fact, you will only receive credit for the mini-question if is completed during the lab period. Instead of pre-lab reading we would like you to reflect on any discrepancies between your results from last week and the expected value and possible explanations for the discrepancy.**

## Experimental Iteration

We noticed that many of your results showed significant discrepancies between the measured speed of sound and the expected result. Please take a moment to reflect on those results. As a scientist, you must often track down the source of seemingly contradictory results:

- Based on your exploratory observations, can the sources of uncertainty you've looked at so far account for the discrepancy?

- Was the experiment flawed, or does the theory need to be modified?

When you come into the lab this week, please set up the experiment *using only your notes from last week* (not the lab manual). If you need to refer back to the lab manual, it is a sign that your notes are insufficiently comprehensive. *Take the time to prepare more detailed notes.*

Once you are confident that you have made a reasonable effort to explore the likely sources of systematic error in this experiment, please proceed to the following mini-question. You should not spend more than 30 minutes in lab before answering this mini-question, in order to ensure you have time to complete the rest of this week's work.

**If you are reading the lab manual before coming to lab please stop reading here!!!**

## Resolving the Puzzle

You have surveyed a range of potential systematic errors and hopefully determined which ones appeared to be the most significant. After such a careful investigation it must have been satisfying to get a result that agreed with the expected value to within experimental error...... unless of course that is not what you got. 

Throughout this course we have we have asked you to pay careful attention to uncertainties. Here are some sample results reported by students last semester:

| Speed of Sound          | Uncertainty  | 
| ----------------------- | ------------ | 
| 360.5 m/s               | 1.2 m/s      | 
| 369.1 m/s               | 1.1 m/s      |
| 359.1 m/s               | 1.7 m/s      |

If you have appropriately controlled for systematic errors and accounted for random errors, your results should differ from the true value by approximately their uncertainty. That is not the case for the sample data above.  

But perhaps you still feel the above results are "close enough" to the expected value (343 m/s at $$20^{o}$$C). The results above differ from the expected value for the speed of sound by amounts on the order of _ten times_ their uncertainty! To get a sense of how unlikely that is, for a normal distribution a $$5 \sigma$$ event, (i.e. 5 error bars away from the mean) has a probability of 1 in $$\approx$$3.5 million, and a $$6 \sigma$$ event has a probability of 1 in $$\approx$$500 million. Clearly we should give some more thought to explaining the discrepancy between these results and the expected value.

When experimental results don't agree with the expected value it is a good idea to:
1. Check to make sure you trust your experimental results. Were you careful to minimize potential sources of systematic error?  Do other groups in your section see results consistent with yours, or could they point you toward a mistake you are making?
2. Check to make sure you trust the "expected value." For example, 343 m/s is the accepted value of the speed of sound under a specific set of conditions. Do those match the conditions in the lab? 343 m/s is the appropriate speed at $$20^{o}$$C. While the speed of sound depends on temperature, our laboratory conditions were close enough to $$20^{\circ}$$ C that we aren't going to be able to explain the discrepancy with temperature. You might also consider pressure, but the dependence of the speed of sound on pressure is extremely weak.
3. When all else fails it can be a good idea to check if you are confident in your theory. 

The theory we have relied upon assumes plane waves of sound (waves of frequency $$\nu$$ traveling at speed $$V$$ with planar wavefronts distance $$\lambda$$ apart). Wouldn't it be nice if we could _see_ the sound waves to assess if this is a reasonable assumption?  It turns out we can, and we have!  You used sugar last week to visualize the shape of the standing waves.  If you don't have a record of this, quickly repeat the exercise now and record your observations.

Take a look at the pattern of the sound waves using sugar - you should see significant deviations from plane wave behavior. The curved wavefronts you see can be mathematically modeled by integrating up a distribution of plane waves propagating in slightly different directions.  By analyzing the math in detail, we can find that the effective wavelength of a focused wave like the one in our amplifier is distorted away from that of a plane wave!  Rather than the wavelength $$\lambda$$ that appears in the simple plane-wave relationship $$\lambda\nu=V$$, what we have measured in our focused standing wave is a slightly different _effective wavelength_ $$\lambda_{\rm eff}$$. 

You will not be responsible for the details of the more complete theory but are encouraged to [read a summary here](gouy).  The **bottom line** is this:

You can account for the 3D structure of the standing waves by applying the following correction to get the actual wavelength ($$\lambda$$) from  your measured value, $$\lambda_{\rm eff}$$:

\begin{equation}
  \lambda = \frac{\lambda_{\rm eff}}{1+\frac{1}{\pi n}}
\end{equation}

For our acoustic levitators, the instructors have determined that $$n=4.5 \pm 0.25$$. ([see previously mentioned supplemental materials](gouy)). 

Please make use of this correction to estimate the speed of sound. Do you get a more reasonable result?


## Goals for This Week

At the end of this week you should have a final determination of the speed of sound based on careful measurements and the revised theory.  You will need to:
+ measure bead spacing by photographing beads with a ruler as an appropriately-placed scale bar.  Measuring bead spacing in pixels offers much finer resolution than direct measurement with a ruler.
+ combine data from at least five different images, resetting whatever features of the experiment are required to randomize important systematic errors.
+ calculate speed of sound from your measured $$\lambda_{eff}$$ using the revised theory, and calculate uncertainty in speed of sound based on both uncertainty in $$\lambda_{eff}$$ and uncertainty in $$n$$.
+ make sure you have comprehensive photographs of your apparatus before leaving lab today.  These should not just be the images you analyze, but additional photographs that show the placement and orientation of the levitator, ruler, imaging camera, and anything else that is relevant to understanding your results.

## Things to Turn In

+ Since this is the end of a module, there will be no weekly checkpoint.
+ Bring a rough draft of your Module 1 lab report (hard copy, please!) to class next week for peer review.
+ The final version of your Module 1 lab report will be due three days before the next module begins, as stated in the syllabus.  As a reminder, the report due dates are:

  + Monday sections:  report due Friday 9/30 at 10p.m.
  + Wednesday sections:  report due Sunday 9/25 at 10p.m.
  + Thursday sections:  report due Monday 9/26 at 10p.m.
  + Friday sections:  report due Tuesday 9/27 at 10p.m.

<!-- Please submit the following to Module 1, Checkpoint #2 on Gradescope. 

**As a reminder: Please prepare your assignment in a separate document, enter all entries in a single sitting without using the "save" button and then make use of the "submit" button to submit your work. You may not resubmit your work once it has been submitted (and saving in Gradescope is equivalent to submitting).**

+ A link to your organized assigned spreadsheet with your data and analysis.

+ A picture of your experimental setup. You do not need to include a scale bar this week, but you should have a plan for adding one next week (i.e., there needs to be an item in your picture whose dimensions you know).

+ A histogram for each mass tested, showing the distribution of the number of data points collected as a function of the angle $$\theta_c$$. You should have collected data for five different masses, with a minimum of 5 data points for each mass. Note that 5 data points is a minimum; you may need to collect more data to have reasonable histograms. If so, make sure you include all of the data you have collected in your histograms (or clearly indicate in your spreadsheet why some data was excluded).

+ The value you obtained for the coefficient of static friction, $$\mu_s$$, for 3 of the 5 masses (smallest, middle, and largest), including the estimated uncertainty. The $$\mu_s$$ value for each mass should be based on data from all trials shown in your histogram for that mass.  Please make sure to use significant figures appropriately. If unsure please reread the section on significant figures, come to office hours to discuss, and/or consult your classmates through Piazza.

+ A single-sentence, preliminary conclusion that you can draw about the hypothesis based on your experimental data

## Grading Considerations:
Your work will be graded based on:

+ organization of your spreadsheet
+ correct calculation of expected results - the calculations must be performed within the provided spreadsheet
+ a clear image of the experimental setup (without unnecessary distractions)
+ image of the experimental setup includes everything of significance to understanding the experiment: phone, container, weights used, any apparatus used to aid in the controlled raising of the ramp and recording of data,...
+ histograms show good quality data with a reasonable distribution
+ axes are appropriately labelled and include correct units
+ results are not rounded prior to the final result
+ final result is presented with appropriate significant figures -->
