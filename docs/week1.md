For all experiments in this course, you will keep a data sheet (Google Sheet) and a lab notebook (Google Doc) that are individually assigned to you through Google Classroom.  Before you can access your assigned documents, you must first go to Google Classroom through a Chrome browser logged into your g.hmc.edu account and join the class with classroom code: **kvcagws** - or use this [link](https://classroom.google.com/c/NTgxMTg4NTYwMDk0?cjc=kvcagws){:target="_blank"}. After you've done this once, you will not have to log into Google classroom separately again; all links to documents we provide through Google classroom in this lab manual should work.  Once you've signed up for Google classroom you will also receive links to your assigned spreadsheet and lab notebook via e-mail, or you can access them through Google classroom under classwork.

Please make sure to join Google classroom from your g.hmc.edu account. Students from other Claremont colleges taking the course should consult HMC's CIS support if you have any issues - they will issue you a g.hmc.edu account. **The course will not appear in your Google Classroom account until you join the course with the class code.**

Throughout an experiment -- but especially in the exploratory phase, when unsure what factors influence your measurement -- it can be especially important to take detailed notes. Organizing a digital lab notebook and data spreadsheet can be tricky, so for Week 1 we are providing a [template Google Sheet and Google Doc you should use, assigned from Google Classroom.

**Make sure you have your data spreadsheet and your Module 1 Lab Notebook handy as you go through the content on this page. Please note that we require you to use the provided spreadsheet/lab notebook. The shared spreadsheet will make it easier for us to troubleshoot if any issues come up, and provides a historical record of your data collection. It is acceptable for lab partners to use one spreadsheet for collecting data. However, the partner whose spreadsheet was not used for data collection must 1) make a note in their spreadsheet stating that the data was originally collected in your lab partner's notebook and 2) ensure you have a copy of the complete data set pasted into your own Google classroom assigned spreadsheet before the end of each lab session. Discussion and collaboration is encouraged, but both partners are individually responsible for completing their own analysis and submitting their own work.**


## Preface

Before diving into data collection and analysis we would like to set some expectations. This course centers around the collection, analysis, and communication of experimental data and results. We expect all of these to be conducted with care and integrity.

To make sure we all start on the same page please answer the following mini-questions. (Mini-questions will appear throughout this manual and are required to be completed before you arrive in lab each week. Please see the syllabus for more information regarding mini-questions)  The first mini-question this week is based in part on information you can find in the [course syllabus](https://physics-50.github.io/General/syllabus){:target="_blank"}.

Data Collection:
Please make sure you read the tips for electronic lab notebooks in the syllabus. We emphasize that your notebook is a record of the experiment. Deleting experimental data from a lab notebook is never acceptable. However, it is acceptable to remeasure/reanalyze data because of inaccurate or incorrect initial efforts. This includes retaking data with an improved experimental procedure.  The guide to uncertainties and error analysis also contains a section on how and when it is acceptable to exclude data from analysis. 

An example of an acceptable note keeping and data collection would be: You are trying to time how fast your little brother can run. Initially you do this in your hallway but you realize you are getting unreliable results. You take him to a track and restart the experiment in a way that is less sensitive to the initial conditions. You make a note next to the data you collected with a procedure you believe to be less reliable and then focus on the newly collected data in your analysis, but you do not delete the original data from your lab notebook.

## Background

In this module, you will be working with a rather cool little piece of equipment: the acoustic levitator!  This device uses the power of sound waves to levitate small objects, and has applications in [*various kinds*](https://www.popsci.com/science/sound-levitation-spinning-particles/){:target="_blank"} [*of research*](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep13596){:target="_blank"} [*and technology development*](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abn7614){:target="_blank"}.  In this module, we will be levitating small styrofoam beads and using them to measure the speed of sound.  A quick review of wave phenomena and vocabulary will be useful before you get started in the lab.

<!--Often the first step is to do some background reading and theoretical analysis. We are measuring the coefficient of static friction, a dimensionless number that depends on the two surfaces in contact. This video from Prof. Arlett on how $$\mu_s$$ and $$\theta_c$$ are related will provide some background and a quick refresher:
[<img src="images/static-friction-video-preview.png" alt="refresher on how mu_s is related to theta_c" width="400"/>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YJCo0SK2Mi3Z8hzRhgZ8WHyLzuaXgzMx/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}

In your lab notebook, try the derivation yourself and document the result. -->

Waves are rather ubiquitous in everyday life, whether they are ocean waves crashing on a beach or fans doing "the wave" around a sports stadium.  As you learned in Physics 24, a wave is a disturbance that travels through a medium.  In a wave traveling in the $$+x$$ direction at **speed $$V$$**, the disturbance $$y$$ away from equilibrium obeys $$y(x,t) = f(x-Vt)$$, for an arbitrary function $$f$$.  We often study sinusoidal waves, in which $$y=A\sin{(kx-\omega t)} = A\sin{[2\pi(\frac{x}{\lambda}-\nu t)]}$$.  Here **$$A$$ is the _amplitude_** of the wave, **$$\nu$$ is the _frequency_**, **$$\omega = 2\pi\nu$$ is the _angular frequency_**, and **$$\lambda$$ is the _wavelength_**.  Try not to confuse $$\nu$$  (the Greek letter "nu") with $$V$$!

Comparing the expressions for a general wave and a sinusoidal wave above, you can derive the relationship **$$V = \lambda\nu$$** for the speed of a wave in terms of is wavelength and frequency.  (Try this derivation yourself and document it in your lab notebook.)  This equation will be central to your data analysis in this module, since you will excite a standing wave of sound at a known frequency, measure the wavelength, and infer the speed of sound.

#### Mini-question: Sinusoidal Wave Quantities
*[Click here to open in a new tab](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRGNia7Lbw8mW0D3XkbXyBzoKLazHHKiTZpJJnKjYUPRCOOQ/viewform){:target="_blank"}*

------------------------------

The easiest waves to visualize are *transverse waves*, in which the disturbance of the medium is perpendicular to the direction in which the wave travels.  Fans at a stadium make a transverse wave, since they individually move up and down while the wave itself  -- the pattern of disturbance -- travels sideways around the arena.  Sound waves, however, are *longitudinal waves*:  the individual air molecules oscillate parallel to the direction in which the wave is propagating.  To better understand the distinction, take a look at the following animations:

<img class="wp-image-1517" src="https://www.physics.hmc.edu/~physics50/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/transverse-longitudinal-waves2.gif" alt="" width="529" height="320" />

The animations above show transverse (left) and longitudinal (right) travelling waves. Sound waves are longitudinal and look like the right-hand picture. To convince yourself that the individual particles are actually oscillating, follow the motion of one of the red dots on the right.  Animation credit D. Russell.

If you like, you can play with another type of longitudinal wave in the Physics 50 lab; get a tall person to excite a longitudinal wave in one of the slinkies hanging from the ceiling.

If waves of the same amplitude and frequency travel through a medium in opposite directions, they sum to form a disturbance pattern that does not appear to move, but only to oscillate in time.  This is called a **_standing wave_**. The mathematical details can be summed up as follows:  $$y_1(x,t) = A\sin{(kx-\omega t)}$$ travels in the $$+x$$ direction, $$y_2(x,t) = A\sin{(kx+\omega t)}$$ travels in the $$-x$$ direction, and their sum is $$y_{tot} = y_1 + y_2 = 2A\sin{(kx)}\cos{(\omega t)}$$ via the magic of trig identities.  The same phenomenon is illustrated by the figure below:

<img class="size-full wp-image-1493" src="https://www.physics.hmc.edu/~physics50/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/standing-waves.gif" alt="" width="288" height="288" />

Above is a  standing wave formed by counter-propagating sine waves. The blue standing wave is the sum of the upper two traveling waves. Animation credit D. Russell.

While the animation above is a great illustration of how traveling waves sum to make a standing wave, the transverse waves shown don't give a great visual impression of a standing wave of sound.  The figure below gives a clearer sense of how individual air molecules move in a standing wave of sound:

<img class="wp-image-1520" src="https://www.physics.hmc.edu/~physics50/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/standing-displacement-antinode-vert-cropped-4.gif" alt="" width="600" height="416" />

The animation above shows a standing wave of sound in air. In the left animation we see the air particles oscillating up and down, creating regions of high and low pressure. The middle animation represents the displacement from equilibrium of individual particles as a function of position (and how it changes over time). The right animation represents the deviation from equilibrium pressure as a function of position; the midpoint about which the pressure oscillates is the equilibrium pressure, not zero pressure. Notice the motion of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">red particles</span> for various locations and how the displacement and pressure animations relate to that motion.

A standing wave has locations where the displacement from equilibrium is zero at all times.  These are called **_nodes_**.  Locations where the displacement from equilibrium varies most over time are called **_antinodes_**.  In the animation above, the bottom red dot is located at a displacement node, which is a pressure antinode.  The top red dot oscillates around a displacement antinode, which is a pressure node.

You have probably studied _resonant_ standing waves, in which the component traveling waves are caused by a single incoming wave reflecting off boundaries at ends of a string or pipe.  In that case the geometry of the violin string or organ pipe dictates that only certain wavelengths (and therefore frequencies) will produce significant sound.  By contrast, our acoustic levitator employs _non-resonant_ standing waves; the two traveling waves come from two sets of speakers pointed in opposite directions and continually pushing air back and forth to produce sound.  The allowed frequencies are limited only by the electromechanical response of the speakers to the signal we use to drive them.

Finally, how do our standing waves of sound trap and levitate solid particles?  Certainly air can push or pull solid objects -- just think of dust in a vacuuum cleaner or a beach umbrella in the wind.  The forces in the acoustic levitator are more complicated, since the pressure and air movement in any given spot is oscillating back and forth many times a second.  You might imagine that solid objects would simply be tugged back and forth in time with the wave instead of being stably trapped.  However, because the standing waves oscillate much too fast for macro-sized objects to follow the cycles of push and pull, the objects instead end up experiencing an effective force propotional to the time average of the square of the pressure.  You can read up on the theory of this acoustic radiation pressure if you like (see Gorkov, 1961 and Marzo et al., 2017), but you do not need to understand the details for this lab.  You should simply know that **beads end up trapped stably at pressure nodes of the standing wave**.

<!-- ## Formulating a Hypothesis

We can now try to think of a hypothesis we can test with an experiment. As a quick check, according to the theory, which factors will affect a measurement of $$\theta_c$$?

#### Mini-question: Critical Angle Factors
[*Click here to open in a new tab*](https://forms.gle/oUrvxpsg5foNjnVH7){:target="_blank"}

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfFH6ZBvZzAlN_LNJQqnmFCPN97KyLGW44mU-AsTd_XSAxcTw/viewform?embedded=true" width="640" height="300" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loading…

-----

Based on this answer, can you think of any hypotheses you could try to test? 

**While there are many different hypotheses you might consider, for Module 1 we will all test the same hypothesis. The hypothesis we will test is:**

*"The coefficient of static friction between two surfaces as measured by the critical angle at which an object slips is independent of the mass of the sliding object."* -->

<!-- ## Instrumentation

Now that we've decided what hypothesis we are going to test, we need to figure out what equipment and experimental tools we are going to use. For this module, a ramp, container, and different masses (bags of bolts) that can be placed in the container were provided to you in the kit you should have collected for module 1. Each of the bags of bolts and the container have been labelled with their mass. Please do not open the bags of bolts!

To measure the angle you will use your phone and the **Phyphox** App. Please go to [phyphox.org](https://phyphox.org){:target="_blank"} (or to the app store on your device) and download the phyphox app. Try to do this before you come to class for the first day of lab. After downloading, find the "Inclination" tool and test that it works correctly with your phone.

<img src="images/phyphox.png" alt="phyphox.org inclination tool" width="400"/>

Make note of your equipment in your lab notebook (record keeping is important) and record any other notes you think might be helpful if someone else were trying to replicate your setup. Remember: for the praciticum you will only have access to your Google-classroom-assigned lab notebook and data sheet.

## Goals for This Week

The goal of this week is to be able to successfully levitate small styrofoam beads in a standing wave of sound, and to use the positions of levitated beads to determine the speed of sound, $$V_{sound}$$.  At the end of this week, you should have a prediction, based on your results, that anyone doing careful measurements using this apparatus is likely to obtain a $$V_{sound}$$ result within a certain range of values.  You will express this range by quoting your experimentally determined $$V_{sound} \pm \delta V_{sound}$$.

## Instrumentation

Your first goal is to create a standing wave with the acoustic levitator. At your station you will see three main pieces of equipment that will help you make this happen.  First, you have a **function generator** (FG, shown on the right; the power supply on the left will be important later):

[![Image of FG](images/fg_and_power.jpg)](images/fg_and_power.jpg)

The periodic signal from the function generator will make the speakers produce sound of a particular frequency.  Adjusting the waveform, frequency, amplitude and offset are done as follows:

+ Turn on the function generator.
+ Select the waveform using the buttons to the right of the display.
    + Adjust the FREQUENCY using the F1 button on the function generator. Use the number pad to type in the numerical frequency desired, and then press the button with the appropriate units (Hz, kHz, MHz) to the right of the numbers; press enter when done. Note: If you would only like to adjust the frequency a bit from its present value you can also use the dial.
    + Adjust the AMPLITUDE and OFFSET settings using the F2 and F3 buttons. Again, use the number pad to type in your desired value followed by a button for the units; press enter.
    + Press the "ON" button above the output of the function generator to make sure it is ON (illuminated and producing a signal).

You must choose what settings on the function generator will produce sound waves that levitate beads most reliably. For now, **set the function generator (FG) to create a SQUARE wave with a frequency of 40 kHz, an amplitude of 5 V, and an offset of 2.5 V**. The square wave, amplitude, and offset settings work best with the logic circuit that processes the function generator signal to produce input to the speakers. The speakers themselves have the best electromechanical response near 40 kHz, but you can check that -- and refine it for your particular setup -- a bit later. You can turn the output OFF for now (button above the output port).

Now, turn your attention to the **acoustic levitator** itself:

<img class="wp-image-1588 size-full" src="https://www.physics.hmc.edu/~physics50/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/levitator-back.png" alt="" width="469" height="327">

Set the switch on the levitator to “AMP.” The switch has 3 possible positions, so make sure it is pressed all the way to “AMP.” This sets the output from the FG to be the logic input for a digital driver located inside the acoustic levitator box. A digital driver uses a logic input of "low" or "high" as the instruction to switch between outputs of 0 V and whatever voltage is supplied to it by a separate power supply (labeled PS OUTPUT (+)). Thus, the output of the driver will be a square wave oscillating at the same frequency as the function generator, switching between 0 V and the output voltage of the power supply (once you connect it).

The L298N Motor Drive Controller Board has on-board logic that needs to be powered at 5V. This is separate from the power supply voltage that will pass through the PS terminal. The 5V logic supply input is connected to a USB power adapter. You should plug this adapter in to one of the wall outlets on your bench. A red light on the L298N board will turn on.

In the picture of the acoustic levitator above, the inputs for both the function generator and power supply are highlighted. There should already be BNC cables attached to both of these on your apparatus.  Find the BNC cable connected to the “FG” input on the levitator case. Connect its other end to the "output" port of your function generator.  Do not connect the power supply.

Safety Warning: Whenever you are connecting elements in a circuit, make sure the power supply is off. Do not turn on the power supply until you have completed the circuit.  Leave the function generator powered on, so the settings you entered are preserved, but leave its output off (button above the output port not illuminated).

Finally, focus on the **power supply**.  With the power supply turned off, turn all its front-panel knobs completely to the left (counter-clockwise) to ensure there is no voltage or current being supplied.  Make sure that the negative (–, black) terminal on the power supply is connected to the ground (GND, green) terminal. This simple connection ensures that the levitator apparatus, power supply and function generator all have a common ground. If there is no metal clip connecting the black and green terminals, notify your instructor and together you can make this connection with a small piece of wire.

Find your station's BNC/banana adapter, and connect the red banana connector to the red positive (+) output on the power supply and the black banana connector to the ground (green) output of the power supply. Connect the output of this adapter to the BNC cable already plugged in to the “PS” input on the levitator case.

Safety Tip: Never touch the two leads of the power supply together! This will short circuit the power supply and could damage it.

Now turn on the power supply. The light labeled C.V. (coarse voltage) should be green, meaning that the output of the power supply is limited by the voltage dial settings. Make sure the function generator is turned on and turn on its output (button above output port). Turn the coarse dial for the voltage slowly up (clockwise). Observe that the voltage reading on the front panel of the power supply rises, but the current stays at zero. The power supply might make clicking sounds - this is okay. 

When you reach a voltage output of around 6-10 volts, the current will start to rise, the green C.V. light will go off and the red C.C. light will go on. At this point both the current and the voltage will stop rising in response to further increases of the coarse voltage dial. The red C.C. light indicates that the power supply output is now being limited by the current dial settings. Turn the coarse current dial up until the green C.V. light comes back on. Alternate between increasing the voltage setting and the current setting as necessary until you have reached an output voltage between 12 and 14 V. **Do not exceed 15 V. Keep an eye on how much current the power supply is providing. If it goes above 225 mA (0.225 A) turn it down immediately** and check your circuit or ask an instructor. 

At this point, if all is well, your acoustic levitator is producing standing waves of sound.

### Checking Best Drive Frequency

Before levitating beads, check your standing wave's structure and strength by visualizing it with the aid of sugar crystals.  As neatly as possible -- no sugar all over the floor, please! -- pour your sugar packet onto one of the black cardboard rectangles at your station and spread it out across the central third or half of the cardboard.  Gently slide the cardboard into the cavity of the acoustic levitator, holding it near the center axis, until you see a pattern forming in the sugar.  Take note of the pattern (a photo might be a great addition to your lab notebook) and the speed of the sugar crystals' movement.

Now vary the frequency of the function generator signal.  Select frequency and use the arrows to toggle to the tenths place on the screen.  Use the dial to change the frequency by 0.1 kHz at a time.  The sugar will form a clearer pattern with stronger movement when you are closer to the frequency at which the speakers respond best.  You may decide this is exactly 40 kHz or something slightly different, but be sure to record the frequency you choose.  If several different frequencies all produce strong standing waves, you can choose any of them.

Make sure you record which levitator you are using (they are numbered), so that you can be sure you have the same levitator next week.  Different units may respond well at slightly different frequencies.

### Levitating a Bead

Now try to levitate a styrofoam bead (or two or ten)! 

Place a few beads on a lens wipe or dryer sheet and move them around between the speakers of the acoustic levitator, near the central axis, until they hop into position. This should not be too difficult. If beads will not levitate, double check all your connections, the function generator settings (including if the output is on), and that the light on the driver is on. See the following [video for demonstrations of a few ways to load a bead into the levitator](https://youtu.be/YrpVdlcYu7Y){:target="_blank"}.  Ask an instructor if problems persist.


## Collecting Data

Once you have loaded beads into two or more adjacent nodes of the standing wave, you are ready to measure bead spacing to find the wavelength and speed of your sound waves.  Before embarking on a careful -- and probably time-consuming -- series of repeated measurements, you should always do some explorations to troubleshoot your basic approach and find out what factors within your control are relevant to ensuring high-quality results.  There is no point in carefully controlling something that changes your result by 1%, while ignoring a systematic error that shifts all your results by 20% or even a factor of two!

+ Perform and analyze a single measurement (yes, one trial) reasonably but quickly, to check that your basic approach is working.  (For instance, your speed of sound should not be a few centimeters per second, or greater than the speed of light.  Since others have measured the speed of sound before you, perhaps you can look up the accepted value and ensure that you are within a factor of two.)

+ Get an understanding of the repeatability and precision of your measurement.  What options do you have for measuring bead spacing?  Hint:  you have a ruler, but you also have the ability to take a picture of the levitated beads with the ruler as a scale bar.  How do your choices influence the precision you can achieve?

+ Check other factors that might affect your measurement and its reproducibility. (Creativity is encouraged!)

Make sure you are taking notes on your exploratory observations as you go so that you have a record of them (reminder: we have set up [a spreadsheet for you on Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/c/NDk3MzIzMTc5MDg1?cjc=uuhmwg5){:target="_blank"}; use the "Week 1: Exploratory Observations" tab to record your data in this section. The template already set up could be a good place for you to record data, or you could modify it to fit your process.)

After settling on a method that you trust to give you reproducible (precise) and unbiased (accurate) results, take at least five separate measurements to find the wavelength of your sound waves using that method.  Use the mean and S.E.M. of your wavelength results to find a value and uncertainty for $$V_{sound}$$.  Your instructor may ask each group to share these results with the class.


<!-- ## Introduction to Experimental Uncertainty

The "Uncertainty Introduction" has information we are going to need in Ph50 about treating sources of experimental uncertainty. For this week please read the [overview on uncertainties](uncertainty-introduction-overview-only){:target="_blank"}.  This is an excerpt from a more extended guide that we will return to in later sections. 

## Reproducibility

Read [this discussion about random uncertainty](uncertainty-introduction#random-uncertainty) 

The goal of testing repeatability is to get a sense of the random error associated with variations in the measurement from trial to trial. 

Take a few (maybe five) measurements of $$\theta_c$$ under identical conditions. Make sure you "reset" your experimental setup each time: start the ramp from a horizontal position ($$\theta = 0$$), place the block onto the ramp, and then slowly start to raise the ramp.  Resetting helps ensure that if individual measurements are less than ideal in some way, at least they are not all biased in the same way as each other.

Trial #	| $$\theta_c$$ (degrees)	
|:-------:|:-------------------------:|

4	|		


Using the information provided in the [discussion on random uncertainty](uncertainty-introduction#random-uncertainty), calculate the standard error of the mean [SEM] for your data.
    
Reducing random uncertainty can include both improving our measurement technique to reduce the spread in our data and  taking many repeated trials. It is often helpful to do both. This is also your chance to take some initiative. The approach you use to measure the angle at which the container begins to slip will significantly affect the reproducibility. You should give some consideration to how to reliably determine the critical angle - trying to press a button on your phone as the container is starting to move while holding the ramp is unlikely to yield reproducible results. Take the time to explore techniques that might help you to get more reproducible results. Your kit includes a piece of string and a binder clip that you can use to attach it to the ramp which you may or may not find helpful. If you aren't sure where to start talk to your instructor. You may find it helpful to know that Phyphox can record data for later extraction. If you click on an angle vs. time graph and then use **Pick data**, you can select and read off the value of data points after the fact. This is helpful if, for example, you are quickly lowering the ramp when the container begins to slip and then going back to find the maximum angle; if you know the critical angle was the highest angle reached, you don't need to press any buttons on the phone during the experiment. Alternatively you might consider using a second phone to record the experiment including your Phyphox screen, so you can go back and more accurately determine the moment at which the container began to slip. Designing/setting up the experiment in a way that will allow you to get reproducible results is a critical part of the experimental process and of this course. Don't assume that more complicated must be better; let the reproducibility of data, and your own observations of failure modes, be your guides. -->

First, complete this mini-question to ensure you are doing the calculation correctly:

+  Calculate the uncertainty in your measurement of the coefficient of static friction ($$\delta \mu_s$$) by propagating your uncertainty $$\delta{\theta_c}$$, the SEM of your measured values. Derive any formulas you use in your lab notebook. Your calculation of $$\delta {\mu_s}$$ should appear in your Google Sheets notebook (please follow the organization of our template and enter formulas in the indicated regions). Remember that we expect your calculations to be done within Google sheets, i.e. in order to receive full credit for your work you should use formulas in Google Sheets to do the math and not a calculator.

 Is your fractional uncertainty reasonable,  (fractional uncertainty $$\equiv \frac{\delta{\mu_s}}{\mu_s} \ll 1$$)? In other words, confirm that the uncertainty in $$\mu_s$$ less than the value of $$\mu_s$$ itself?

One of the goals of this course is that you take the time to think about careful experimental procedure. You will be graded on your quality of data as part of your deliverable at the end of each module. If you feel there may be issues with your results but are unsure how to improve your procedure, speak to your instructor.


## Significant Figures when Reporting Results

When doing your analysis, to avoid an accumulation of rounding errors it is very important not to round your results until you reach a final result. However when you do reach a final result, it is important and helpful to round your result appropriately, taking into consideration your uncertainty. Since the uncertainty is a measure of your confidence in your result it makes sense to use it to gauge which digits are *significant*.

Please read through this [guide](Significant-figures) for reporting final results with appropriate significant figures. You should refer back to these guidelines and follow them throughout this course. For future reference you will find a link to this and other guides on the "helpful guidance" tab on Sakai.

Significant figure guidelines apply to final reported results. In this class this will be specifically when you type in a final result in Gradescope or in a figure caption. Please do not round your results at any time within your spreadsheets (although it is okay to adjust the settings in your spreadsheet to display fewer digits if you wish to do so; talk to your instructor if you would like to do this and are unsure how to do so.)  -->

 
## Things to Turn In

In the middle of a module, weekly checkpoints should be submitted on Gradescope. This week's checkpoint checks your data analysis and error propagation skills. Deadlines for weekly checkpoints are given in the syllabus, but here's a reminder:

+ Monday sections: due Fridays at 10 pm
+ Wednesday sections: due Sundays at 10 pm
+ Thursday sections: due Mondays at 10 pm
+ Friday sections: due Tuesdays at 10 pm

And to double-check, make sure you have finished all of this week's mini-questions by [checking here](mini-questions#week-1){:target="_blank"} before this week's lab.



<!-- Please note that since all sections use the same Gradescope portal the deadlines listed on Gradescope are not accurate for all sections and cannot be relied upon. -->

<!-- **When grading the checkpoint we will look for the following:**
+ Were all calculations completed correctly?
+ Does your data look reasonable for the experiment?
+ Did you round too early? (Remember to only round your data when sharing the final result, not during intermediate calculations.)
+ Did you make appropriate use of significant figures when reporting your final result?
+ Did you provide a link to your own spreadsheet, assigned through Google classroom?
+ Is your spreadsheet organized with appropriate annotations if any issues arose during data collection?
+ Does your procedure adequately lay out a method to generate reproducible measurements of the critical angle? 
+ Deductions for failing to submit the checkpoint on time will be applied as outlined in the syllabus -->
