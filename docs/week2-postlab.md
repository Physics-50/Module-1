# Module 1 Week 2 Postlab

## Things to Turn In

+ Since this is the end of a module, there will be no weekly checkpoint.
+ Bring a rough draft of your Module 1 lab report (hard copy, please!) to class next week for peer review.
+ The final version of your Module 1 lab report will be due three days before the next module begins, as stated in the syllabus.  As a reminder, the report due dates are:

  + Monday sections:  report due Friday at 10p.m.
  + Wednesday sections:  report due Sunday at 10p.m.
  + Thursday sections:  report due Monday at 10p.m.
  + Friday sections:  report due Tuesday at 10p.m.

<!-- Please submit the following to Module 1, Checkpoint #2 on Gradescope. 

**As a reminder: Please prepare your assignment in a separate document, enter all entries in a single sitting without using the "save" button and then make use of the "submit" button to submit your work. You may not resubmit your work once it has been submitted (and saving in Gradescope is equivalent to submitting).**

+ A link to your organized assigned spreadsheet with your data and analysis.

+ A picture of your experimental setup. You do not need to include a scale bar this week, but you should have a plan for adding one next week (i.e., there needs to be an item in your picture whose dimensions you know).

+ A histogram for each mass tested, showing the distribution of the number of data points collected as a function of the angle $$\theta_c$$. You should have collected data for five different masses, with a minimum of 5 data points for each mass. Note that 5 data points is a minimum; you may need to collect more data to have reasonable histograms. If so, make sure you include all of the data you have collected in your histograms (or clearly indicate in your spreadsheet why some data was excluded).

+ The value you obtained for the coefficient of static friction, $$\mu_s$$, for 3 of the 5 masses (smallest, middle, and largest), including the estimated uncertainty. The $$\mu_s$$ value for each mass should be based on data from all trials shown in your histogram for that mass.  Please make sure to use significant figures appropriately. If unsure please reread the section on significant figures, come to office hours to discuss, and/or consult your classmates through Piazza.

+ A single-sentence, preliminary conclusion that you can draw about the hypothesis based on your experimental data

## Grading Considerations:
Your work will be graded based on:

+ organization of your spreadsheet
+ correct calculation of expected results - the calculations must be performed within the provided spreadsheet
+ a clear image of the experimental setup (without unnecessary distractions)
+ image of the experimental setup includes everything of significance to understanding the experiment: phone, container, weights used, any apparatus used to aid in the controlled raising of the ramp and recording of data,...
+ histograms show good quality data with a reasonable distribution
+ axes are appropriately labelled and include correct units
+ results are not rounded prior to the final result
+ final result is presented with appropriate significant figures -->
