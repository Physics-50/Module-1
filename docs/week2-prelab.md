# Module 1 Week 2 Pre-lab


There is no pre-lab for this week.

**The instructions in this week's lab manual do not need to be read in advance. The embedded mini-question should be completed in lab this week rather than in advance; in fact, you will only receive credit for the mini-question if is completed during the lab period. Instead of pre-lab reading we would like you to reflect on any discrepancies between your results from last week and the expected value and possible explanations for the discrepancy.**
