## Things to Turn In

In the middle of a module, weekly checkpoints should be submitted on Gradescope. This week's checkpoint checks your data analysis and error propagation skills. 




Deadlines for weekly checkpoints are given in the syllabus, but here's a reminder:

+ Monday sections: due Fridays at 10 pm
+ Wednesday sections: due Sundays at 10 pm
+ Thursday sections: due Mondays at 10 pm
+ Friday sections: due Tuesdays at 10 pm

And to double-check, make sure you have finished all of this week's mini-questions by [checking here](mini-questions#week-1){:target="_blank"} before this week's lab.
